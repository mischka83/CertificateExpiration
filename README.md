# CertificationExpiration
## Description
you are a certificate administrator and would like to get an overview of which certificates will expire in the near future? Maybe also an automatic notification to a contact person? 
Then this module is exactly the right one for you.

This Module gives you a summary of the expiring certificates as mailreport, as file export and/or passthru to the console.
You can also specify if a mail to the certificate contact or requester will be sent.
